A JDBC(Java Database Connectivity) driver is required as a classpath when running the program
Therefore, you will notice a batch file in the directory that compiles and runs the program
This batch file works on my computer, but probably not yours, unless we somehow have the same exact C: drive
The classpath must be changed to the directory that the JAR file is contained on your computer
